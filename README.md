## War or Peace

An implementation of the card game **War** completed during Module 1 of Turing School's backend program. [Here's](https://github.com/turingschool/backend-curriculum-site/tree/gh-pages/module1/projects/war_or_peace) the original repo with project specs.

### Notes

* Started but did not complete [Iteration 4](https://github.com/turingschool/backend-curriculum-site/blob/gh-pages/module1/projects/war_or_peace/iteration4.md).
* Instead, I automated the card creation in a different way. Instead of using a CSV / txt file to generate cards, I wrote a `create_suit_method` that I used inside the `war_or_peace_runner.rb`.
* Kept a process gist. Check it out [here](https://gist.github.com/gabichuelas/5c3ee5a11adbdb32c15ffdb81dc7c024).

### Game Play

- Clone down the repo
